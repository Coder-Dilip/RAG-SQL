# Django RAG-SQL Project

## Overview

This Django project allows users to upload SQL or SQLite files, which are then processed to generate SQL queries using the Gemini Pro LLM. The results are displayed on the frontend, providing a seamless experience for interacting with the database.

## Features

- **File Upload**: Upload SQL or SQLite files through a web interface.
- **File Conversion**: Convert SQL files to SQLite format if needed.
- **Table Information**: Automatically generate a list of tables and their details.
- **Query Classification**: Analyze user queries to identify relevant tables.
- **SQL Generation**: Generate SQL queries based on user input and table descriptions.
- **Data Retrieval**: Fetch and display data from selected tables.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
   cd yourrepository
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your Google API key:

   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
   ```

5. **Apply Migrations**

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. **Run the Development Server**

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

7. **Access the Application**

   Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to start using the application.

## How It Works

- **`views.py`**: Handles the core logic for file uploads, conversions, query classification, and SQL generation.
  - `classify_query`: Extracts table names based on user queries.
  - `upload_db`: Manages file uploads, converts SQL files to SQLite, and retrieves table information.
  - `get_table_data`: Fetches data from the selected table.
  - `get_table_overview`: Provides an overview of table details and generates SQL queries.

- **HTML Templates**: Two templates are used:
  - `index.html`: The main upload page.
  - `table_list.html`: Displays the list of tables and their details.

## Usage

1. **Upload a Database File**

   Navigate to the upload page and select an SQL or SQLite file to upload.

2. **View Tables and Details**

   After uploading, view the list of tables and their details generated by the Gemini Pro LLM.

3. **Query the Database**

   Use the provided query interface to generate and execute SQL queries based on your input.
